    HTTP/HTTPS Client library that provides comprehensive interface to Robot Framework to control HTTP/HTTPS client.

    See other HttpCtrl libraries:

    - HttpCtrl.Server_ - HTTP Server API for testing where easy-controlled HTTP server is required.

    - HttpCtrl.Json_ - Json related API for testing where work with Json message is required.

    - HttpCtrl.Logging_ - Logging related API to configure the logging system that is used by HttpCtrl library.

    Example how to send GET request to obtain origin IP address and check that response is not empty:

    .. code:: robotframework

        *** Settings ***

        Library         HttpCtrl.Client
        Library         HttpCtrl.Json

        *** Test Cases ***

        Get Origin Address
            Initialize Client   www.httpbin.org
            Send HTTP Request   GET   /ip

            ${response status}=   Get Response Status
            ${response body}=     Get Response Body

            ${expected status}=   Convert To Integer   200
            Should Be Equal   ${response status}   ${expected status}

            ${origin}=    Get Json Value From String   ${response body}   origin
            Should Not Be Empty   ${origin}

    Example how to sent PATCH request using HTTPS:

    .. code:: robotframework

        *** Settings ***

        Library         HttpCtrl.Client
        Library         HttpCtrl.Json

        *** Test Cases ***

        Send HTTPS PATCH Request
            Initialize Client   www.httpbin.org

            ${body}=   Set Variable   { "volume": 77, "mute": false }
            Send HTTPS Request   PATCH   /patch   ${body}

            ${response status}=   Get Response Status
            ${response body}=     Get Response Body
            ${response body}=     Decode Bytes To String   ${response body}   UTF-8

            ${expected status}=   Convert To Integer   200
            Should Be Equal   ${response status}   ${expected status}

            ${volume}=   Get Json Value From String   ${response body}   json/volume
            Should Be Equal   ${volume}   ${77}

            ${mute}=   Get Json Value From String   ${response body}   json/mute
            Should Be Equal   ${mute}   ${False}
